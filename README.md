### ðŸ§‘ Personal Information / Context
  I was born and raised in Istanbul, Turkey, and made the bold decision to move to the Netherlands in June 2022 when I was 28 years old. 
Now, I am happily settled in Amsterdam, taking on this new adventure. I am gradually adapting to the Dutch culture and have started learning the Dutch language.


### ðŸ§¾ How I like to receive Feedback
  Receiving positive feedback is always uplifting, as it boosts one's morale and confidence. Personally, I appreciate positive feedback, whether it's for completing a challenging task or for my fashion sense! However, I also acknowledge that negative feedback presents an opportunity for growth and improvement.

  Please feel free to provide me with any feedback you may have, whether it's related to code reviews, pull requests, best practices, or any other technological aspect.
I am open to suggestions on how I can enhance my skills and knowledge. Furthermore, if you notice any behavior on my part that you are not satisfied with, please do not hesitate to bring it to my attention. Your feedback is valuable and will assist me in becoming a better version of myself.

### ðŸ¥‚ How I like to give Feedback
  Constructive feedback is a powerful tool for growth and improvement. Rather than viewing it as criticism, it should be seen as an opportunity to collaborate and work together towards improvement. 
  
  Adopting a "together for the better" mindset allows for open communication, mutual understanding, and continuous learning.
By providing and receiving constructive feedback in a respectful and supportive manner, we can collectively strive for excellence and achieve our goals more effectively.

### ðŸ“« How to reach me:
  I prefer one-on-one communication, as it allows for more personalized interactions. If we are both available, you can reach out to me in person, through a Slack message, or simply wave to get my attention when we are both in the office.
